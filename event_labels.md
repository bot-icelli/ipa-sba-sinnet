### Masters/Premier tournament labels in Tennis Abstract URLs.
*still a work in progress*

pre-1990 masters names, ATP:
- iw: 74-75 is `'Tucson'`. 76-78 is `'Palm Springs'`. 79-80 is
`'Rancho Mirage'`. 81-86 is `'La Quinta'`. 87-89 is `'Indian Wells'`
- mia: 85 is `'Delray Beach'`, but that's also a current, separate
tournament. 86 is `'Boca West'`. 87-89 is `'Key Biscayne'`
- mad: n/a (`'Madrid'` is a *separate* tournament that was played from 1972-
1994)
- rome: same name. available back to the 70s.
- can: `'Toronto'`, `'Montreal_/_Toronto'` **(the latter doesn't work in links,
perhaps due to the slash...)**
- cin: same name.
- tour final: 70-89: `'Masters'`

_(from 1990 on, all ATP Masters tournaments include 'Masters' at the end of
their attribute string.)_

pre-2000 names, WTA:
- iw: began in 89. same name every year except one -- `'Palm Springs'`.
However, on the site, that overlaps with the 1978 colgate series championship...
- mia: 85-99 is `'Key Biscayne'`
- mad: n/a
- rome: same name. available back to 79.
- can: `'Canadian Open'`. data goes back to 80.
- cin: not held from 74-87 and 89-03. there was a separate avon tourney from
1980-82 that is also labeled as `'Cincinnati'`, but I have no way to
differentiate it unless i start mixing in other attributes like start/end date.
may not be worth it for 3 years in the 80s.
- **tour final**: at least `'Shenzhen_Finals'`, `'WTA_Championships'`,
`'Singapore'`, `'WTA_Tour_Championships'`,  `'Virginia_Slims_Championships'`.
also need to research more about the colgate series...
