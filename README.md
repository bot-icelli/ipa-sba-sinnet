A Python API for querying Jeff Sackmann's
[Tennis Abstract](http://www.tennisabstract.com/) website, fetching historical
match data from its player data pages, and formatting the results as pandas
DataFrames for use in further analysis.

If you've ever wondered
[how many times Roger Federer has been bageled as a pro](
http://www.tennisabstract.com/cgi-bin/player-classic.cgi?p=RogerFederer&f=ACareerqqC2Q9)
or [how dominant Serena Williams used to be at closing out Grand Slams](
http://www.tennisabstract.com/cgi-bin/wplayer-classic.cgi?p=SerenaWilliams&f=Acx1995103020150810qqC0E0i1),
this package provides a programmatic interface for finding fast answers and
learning more about the results.

**Skills used:**
<br>
_(bear with me; I'm job-hunting)_

Headless browsing in Python with ~~`PyQt5`~~ `selenium`, HTML DOM manipulation,
JavaScript event triggering, cross-browser (Chromium, Firefox) and cross-OS
(Mac, Ubuntu) support, data(Frame) manipulation with `pandas`, cloud-based
Jupyter environment creation with Binder and Docker, testing and continuous
integration with `pytest` and Travis, object-oriented programming, regular
expressions, and a lot of persistence.
