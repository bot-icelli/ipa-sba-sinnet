[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ojustino/tennis-abs-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/ojustino/tennis-abs-api/)

A Python API for querying Jeff Sackmann's
[Tennis Abstract](http://www.tennisabstract.com/) website, fetching historical
match data from its player data pages, and formatting the results as pandas
DataFrames for use in further analysis.

If you've ever wondered
[how many times Roger Federer has been bageled as a pro](
http://www.tennisabstract.com/cgi-bin/player-classic.cgi?p=RogerFederer&f=ACareerqqC2Q9)
or [how dominant Serena Williams used to be at closing out Grand Slams](
http://www.tennisabstract.com/cgi-bin/wplayer-classic.cgi?p=SerenaWilliams&f=Acx1995103020150810qqC0E0i1),
this package provides a programmatic interface for finding fast answers and
learning more about the results.

Skills used:
<br>
_(bear with me; I'm job-hunting)_

Headless browsing with `PyQt5`, HTML DOM manipulation, event triggering in
JavaScript, data(Frame) manipulation with `pandas`, testing with `pytest`,
object-oriented programming, multiple inheritance, regular expressions, and
more.
