A Python API for querying Jeff Sackmann's
<a href="http://www.tennisabstract.com/" target="_blank">Tennis Abstract</a>
website, fetching historical match data from its player data pages, and
formatting the results as `pandas` DataFrames for use in further analysis.

The package creates a thin, programmatic interface for finding quick answers to
questions like
<a href="http://www.tennisabstract.com/cgi-bin/player-classic.cgi?p=RogerFederer&f=ACareerqqC2Q9" target="_blank">
    how many times Roger Federer has been bageled as a pro
</a> or
<a href="http://www.tennisabstract.com/cgi-bin/wplayer-classic.cgi?p=SerenaWilliams&f=Acx1995103020150810qqC0E0i1" target="_blank">
    how dominant Serena Williams used to be at closing out Grand Slams
</a> and then learning more about the results.

**Skills used:**
<br>
_(bear with me; I'm job-hunting)_

Headless browsing in Python with `selenium` (and `PyQt5` in earlier commits),
HTML DOM manipulation, JavaScript event triggering, cross-browser (Chromium,
Firefox) and cross-OS (Mac, Ubuntu) support, Data(Frame) manipulation with
`pandas`, cloud-based Jupyter environment creation with Binder and Docker,
testing and continuous integration with `pytest` and Travis, object-oriented
programming, regular expressions, and a lot of persistence.

The site doesn't have a public API and is designed for front-end, click-based
interaction. Its backend system for querying match data has a number of
<a href="https://github.com/ojustino/tennis-abs-api/blob/master/attributes.md" target="_blank">
    gender and attribute-specific quirks
</a> that I sought to abstract away to create a simple, consistent experience
for Python users.
